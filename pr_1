➔Object Oriented Programming :
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using 
classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by 
providing some concepts:
● Object
● Class 
● Inheritance 
● Polymorphism 
● Abstraction 
● Encapsulation
→ JDK : 
JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. It physically exists. It contains JRE +
development tools.
→JRE : 
JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment. It is used to provide runtime 
environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It phy Implementations of JVMs are also 
actively released by other companies besides Sun 
Micro Systems.
➔ JVM :
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides 
runtime
environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM, JRE and JDK are 
platform
dependent because configuration of each OS differs. But, Java is platform independent. 
The JVM
performs following main tasks:
● Loads code
● Verifies code
● Executes code
● Provides runtime environment 
→JAVADOC :
Javadoc is a documentation generator tool. We need to use Javadoc comments 
in our source code to create descriptive and easy-to-understand documentation. 
Javadoc provides us inbuilt tags which we can use to specify certain properties 
about our code.
→ command line argument : 
In the command line, the arguments passed from the console can be received in the 
java program and they can be used as input. The users can pass the arguments 
during the execution bypassing the command-line arguments inside the main() 
method.
